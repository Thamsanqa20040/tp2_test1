"""Write a python function named “register_party” that takes a list of parties. Each party
must be presented by key value pairs. The keys should be “party_name”, “reg_number”,
“member_count”). The function should check if the new party has acceptable number of
members for it to be registered as per the requirements narrated in the scenario. Note: this
function must be written under the git branch that you created in question 1.4 above."""
